# XFL-Fantasy-Football
  An application that presents the live fantasy football scores using standard ESPN scoring of a list of players for a given weekend of games using beautiful soup web scraping.


# Work In Progress 
  This is a person project That I am working on between my work at Clemson University. I plan to update weekly with a new feture or system the fallowing section shows of each weeks work, along with some of the challenges and soulutions.
  
## Week 0
 This week I prototyped some of the core features of the system. I mainly wanted to see if I would be able pull information from a website (specifically stats.xfl.com) as its updated live with the game. I decided to use the request library along with beautiful soup to do this. I ran into trouble becuse this is a dynamic website the html source uses javaScript witch I am not very familiar with. I was able to get it working in what seams like a convoluted way. Needs updating.
  I was also able to nail down some of my basic objects. Although I think I have too much bad coupling between the objects that made the porject become unweildly quickly. By the end of the week I was able to get the scores to update live with the game although there are a few bugs.
  
## Week 1
  Projects and exams have slowed down devlopment this week but I plan to try and move to a Modle View Controler Dev model for the application becuse it will allow me to easily pivot to implmenting a crude UI so I can use my roomates as QA testers. Also plan to create a few static text files that represnt the rosters. I tried webscrpeing those too but It proved much more difficult than the stats page. Will for now a 'magic roster' will suffice.
